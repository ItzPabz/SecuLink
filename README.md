# VaultTalk - Encrypted Messaging App

VaultTalk is a secure and user-friendly encrypted messaging application developed in Python. It provides end-to-end encryption to protect your conversations from prying eyes. This is/was a school project, and I have no plans to continue development; no support will be offered either.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your messages are encrypted on your device and decrypted only on the recipient's device.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use, intuitive user interface for seamless communication.
- **Group Chats**: Create secure group chats with multiple participants.
- **Cross-Platform**: VaultTalk is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
